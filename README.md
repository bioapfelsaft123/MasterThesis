Welcome to the repo for this master thesis. To run the code, first download the whole repository. Then you can klick "Run All" in the "RunFile". The run file accesses the file where the data gets loaded and processed as well as the files that hold the model classes.
Please note, that you need a Gurobi licence to run the code, as this is the solver that was used for the optimization.
